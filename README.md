Repository storing plots from Espinoza+2024
--------------------------------------------

Each folder has a self-contained version of the plots in the paper, which can be generated via the corresponding `.py` files. Most folders contain an `.svg` file, which contain versions of the plots with publication-quality annotations and/or illustrations added via Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/).
